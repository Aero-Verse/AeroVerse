# YOLO Runway Object Detection

## Introduction
This project implements **real-time object detection** on airport runways using the YOLO model.  
The system identifies aircraft, vehicles, barriers, birds, and other potential hazards to improve aviation safety during takeoff and landing.

## Methodology
- Trained a YOLO model with custom datasets for runway environments.  
- Real-time detection from live video feeds or recorded runway footage.  
- Outputs include bounding boxes, object classes, and confidence scores.  

## Results
- Detects multiple object classes in real-time.  
- Provides early alerts to pilots and air traffic controllers.  
- Enhances runway safety and reduces risks of collisions.  

## Benefits
- **Improved Situational Awareness:** Detects hazards before accidents occur.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduces delays and enhances decision-making.  
- **Scalable:** Can be integrated with airport monitoring systems.  

## Installation
Clone the repository and install YOLO dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/yolo-runway-detection.git
cd yolo-runway-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
