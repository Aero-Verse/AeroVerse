# Weather Forecasting System

## Introduction
This project implements **weather forecasting** for airport runways using XGBoost.  
It predicts short-term weather conditions to improve flight safety and planning.

## Methodology
- Trained with **historical datasets** (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed & direction).  
- Integrated with **real-time location-based data** from the airport site.  
- Provides forecasts with temperature, humidity, wind, and rain probability.  

## Results
- Delivers real-time weather updates and 24-hour forecasts.  
- Outputs displayed on an **interactive map** for better visualization.  
- Supports decision-making for pilots and air traffic control.  

## Benefits
- **Improved Decision-Making:** Real-time alerts help quick responses.  
- **Safe Training:** Mixed reality scenarios for practicing emergency handling.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduces delays and improves safety planning.  

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
